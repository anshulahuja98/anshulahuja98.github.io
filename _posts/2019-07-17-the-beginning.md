### About me
Hey everyone, I am Anshul Ahuja, currently a Pre-final year CSE undergrad at IIT Jodhpur.
I am originally from New Delhi, I did my schooling from DPS Dwarka.
I formerly interned at Microsoft, Hyderabad.
I am a geek of sorts and love experimenting with different technologies.
I love to talk tech/biz with anyone who is up to date with the current tech scenario.

My hobbies are geeky as expected: Speedcubing, listening to podcasts/music, swimming. 


### Motivation for this blog site
The motivation to write this blog is two fold
One type of blog that I am planning to write is to give an overview of my projects to people who would like to contribute to them in any way or learn from them to develop their own projects and learn new technologies.
The second would be my personal blogs talking about my take on various topics ranging from various technologies to personal experiences.

### For the readers
I would really appreciate constant feedback on the blogs, and any suggestions as to the new content that I should discuss about!
Looking forward to hearing from you!
